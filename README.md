# PQC
This project provides an automated, configurable benchmark suite for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, specifically optimized for testing on Apple Silicon (M4) platforms. It is designed to evaluate NIST-standardized algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, Falcon, SPHINCS+) in terms of performance, resource consumption, and stability.
